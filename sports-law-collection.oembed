The text is presented in the traditional law school case method style, with a unique focus on how those regulatory and governance materials can be used to solve problems in sports, from issues like Deflategate to the future of big-time intercollegiate athletics. Whether students are interested in careers in professional or amateur sports law, they will acquire foundational knowledge that will help them identify legal issues, minimize risk, and become a generation of problem solvers within the sports industry. Contracts, torts, agency, labor\/employment, antitrust, and intellectual property law are all addressed, as well as health and safety issues and high school, college, and international\/Olympic\/regulatory concerns. In a world where sports has proven to be a leader, the book also addresses racial and gender equity issues in depth.","brand":"The Drama Book Shop, Inc.","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":35314170364066,"sku":"","price":133.23,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0420\/1532\/6370\/products\/book-007.jpg?v=1595539829"},{"product_id":"the-economics-of-sports","title":"The Economics of Sports","description":"The sports industry provides a seemingly endless set of examples from every area of microeconomics, giving students the opportunity to study economics in a context that holds their interest.
