Robert J. Rhee distinguishes this casebook from other fine books in the field in a number of important ways. This book is interdisciplinary in nature, providing essential coverage of the basic concepts of accounting and finance needed for a business lawyer to understand the economics of the transaction. Additionally, the text facilitates ease of learning and teaching, avoiding excerpting technically dense academic writings in finance and economics, which can intimidate students and teachers. It further provides a basic understanding of financial instruments to prepare students for corporate practice, including many examples of actual financial contract terms and other transactional documents taken from various sources.\u003cbr\u003e Features:\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn depth coverage of accounting, finance, valuation, and capital markets in an accessible manner\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInclusion of transactional documents and focus on financial contracts\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenerous use of graphics, tables, and charts to organize and convey complex information\u003cbr\u003e Accessibility of materials\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBusiness school-style case studies at the end of some chapters\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e","brand":"The Drama Book Shop, Inc.","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":35230674124962,"sku":"","price":219.22,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0420\/1532\/6370\/products\/book-004.jpg?v=1595234391","url":"https:\/\/mylawfirm.myshopify.com\/products\/corporate-finance-aspen-casebook-series","provider":"The Drama Book Shop, Inc.","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
