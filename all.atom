<p>In depth coverage of accounting, finance, valuation, and capital markets in an accessible manner<br></p>

<p>Negotiating technology-related contracts can be a long and energy-consuming business. For the uninitiated or uninformed, the significance of the points under discussion may be unclear, and it can often seem that contract negotiators are pedantic, obstructive or just plain unhelpful in terms of “getting the deal done”.</p>
<p>In this context, it is essential to have a clear understanding of just what each part of the contract is designed to deal with, what both the customer and service provider are seeking to protect, and what potential compromise solutions may be available. As a result, one can avoid unnecessary debate and move faster to reasonable positions that are acceptable to both parties.</p>
<p>This practical, how-to book seeks to explain the perspectives of both sides of the negotiating table on a clause-by-clause basis, clearly setting out the key points they will want to protect – and why – while also offering suggestions as to what they may be willing to concede or compromise upon. It is written with the benefit of DLA Piper’s unparalleled view of the global market for technology sourcing and outsourcing projects, and from acting both for customers and service providers in this space.</p>
<p>An invaluable negotiating guide, this edition will be of particular interest to anyone involved in technology-related contracts.</p>

Uniquely, this book gives detailed information on RAN protocol layers, transport, network architecture and services, as well as practical implementation and deployment issues, making it suitable for researchers and engineers who are designing and developing 5G systems.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the author's 30 plus years of experience in signal processing, microelectronics and wireless communication system design, this book is ideal for professional engineers, researchers and graduate students working and researching in cellular communication systems and protocols as well as mobile broadband wireless standards.</p>
<p>Strong focus on practical considerations, implementation and deployment issues<br> Takes a top-down approach to explain system operation and functional interconnection<br> Covers all functional components, features, and interfaces based on clear protocol structure and block diagrams<br> Describes RF and transceiver design considerations in sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands<br> Covers network slicing, SDN/NFV/MEC networks and cloud and virtualized RAN architectures<br> Comprehensive coverage of NR multi-antenna techniques and beamformed operation<br> A consistent and integrated coverage reflecting the author’s decades of experience in developing 3G, 4G and 5G technologies and writing two successful books in these areas</p>
